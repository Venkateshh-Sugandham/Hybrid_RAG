# Hybrid_RAG
End-to-End system utilizing Langchain for Retrieval-Augmented  Generation (RAG) and Pinecone for vector database management. This system performs hybrid  searches, combining semantic search (dense embeddings) with keyword-based search (sparse  vectors) to retrieve relevant document sections for user queries.
